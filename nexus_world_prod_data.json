Of the 4 known biomes of NEXUS World, the Grass Land are the most bountiful and hospitable to life. They aren't very different from tropical environments from our own world apart from the vast differences in plant species.\n\nWith an abundant selection of plants, food and resources, these areas make great first places to explore for any NEXUS World explorer.\n\nArtwork map from OpenStreetMap (https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)",
